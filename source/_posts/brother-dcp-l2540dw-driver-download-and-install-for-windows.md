 First of all, you should know that there’s no particular driver for a motherboard, but there are drivers for motherboard devices. For more details of what motherboard is and how to update motherboard drivers, you may take a look at **[this post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Some of the most common motherboard drivers include chipset drivers, network card drivers, audio drivers, video drivers and so on. When you try to update these drivers manually for your ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-E gaming motherboard, you should be well clear about their specifications first.

### Option 1 – Update the drivers manually

 ASUS keeps updating drivers for the ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-E gaming motherboard. To get them, you need to visit the **[download website of ASUS](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-STRIX-Z370-E-GAMING/HelpDesk%5FDownload/)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 of 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. Here’s what you’re supposed to do:

1. Go to the **[download webpage](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-STRIX-Z370-E-GAMING/HelpDesk%5FDownload/)**  of ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-E gaming motherboard.
2. On the pop-up page, click the**down arrow button** to the right of**Please select OS** to expand its drop-down list, as illustrated below. Then select your version of the Windows operating system.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-272.png)
3. Then you’ll be presented with a list of drivers available for download.**Note** that not all of them are drivers; some are just useful pieces of software which you may download as well.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-275.png)
