### Option 1: Update your Creative webcam drivers automatically (Recommended)

Driver Easy handles it all.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
