## Essential Guide to Downloading and Installing the Latest Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti Graphics Card Drivers on Windows

If you’re lucky enough to snag the new**GeForce RTX 3060 Ti** , you’re probably looking for the graphics driver to get your card working out of the box. Well, look no further because in this post, we’ll show you two ways to download and install the Game Ready driver.

## 2 ways to get the RTX 3060 Ti driver

**[Option 1: Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-driver-for-windows-10-8-or-7/#option1)**  – This is probably the quickest and fastest way to get driver updates. All it takes are a few clicks.

**[Option 2: Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This requires a certain level of computer knowledge. You can choose to install manually if you’re a tech-savvy user.

### Option 1: Get the latest RTX 3060 Ti driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your RTX 3060 Ti driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
