In this post, we’re going to show you 2 safe and easy ways to get the latest **Corsair Void Pro**  drivers**.**

## 2 options to update Corsair Void Pro drivers in Windows

 There are two ways for you to update the drivers for your Corsair Void Pro headset. Just choose the way you prefer:

1. [**Update your Corsair Void Pro driver automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/corsair-void-drivers-download-install-for-windows-easily/#O1)
2. [**Update your Corsair Void Pro driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Option 1: Update your Corsair Void Pro driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c04aae3578ee-1.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _**ALL**_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5bfa4f05e9160.jpg) You can also click **Update**  to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**Important** : For a complete update, please make sure the old driver for your Corsair Void gaming headset has been uninstalled from your PC.

1. Go to **[Corsair’s official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
2. Check out **DOWNLOADS**   under the **Support**   section.
