 Are you trying to update your Lenovo docking station driver but not sure where to find the latest download? If yes, then you’ve come to the right place. In this post, you’ll have two ways to download and install the driver.

## How to update the Lenovo docking station driver

To update the Lenovo docking station driver, you have two options:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-how-to-update-lenovo-docking-station-drivers/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
