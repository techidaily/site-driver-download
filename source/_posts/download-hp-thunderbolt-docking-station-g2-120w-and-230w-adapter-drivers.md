## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

**Intel** keeps updating the Intel Thunderbolt Controller drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Intel Support](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fsupport%2Fhome%2Fus%2Fen%2F04%2Fdrivers%2Fdriversdetails%3Fdriverid%3D0xcpp)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the driver manually.
