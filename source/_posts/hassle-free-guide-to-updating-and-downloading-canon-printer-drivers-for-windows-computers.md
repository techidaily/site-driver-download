![amd rx-6900 xt driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/amd-rx-6900xt-driver.jpg)

 AMD RX 6900 XT, the newest gaming GPU of AMD’s Radeon 6000 series, has arrived. To enjoy the ultra-high frame rates and serious 4K gameplay as this flagship GPU deserves, you’ll need the latest AMD RX 6900 XT driver.

Here are two ways you can update the driver safely:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-amd-rx-6900-xt-driver-for-windows-7-8-10/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

## Option 1 – Automatically update the AMD RX 6900 XT driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your AMD RX 6900 XT driver by yourself, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:
