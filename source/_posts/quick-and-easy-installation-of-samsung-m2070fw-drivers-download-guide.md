## Why you need the Razer mamba driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.

## How to update the Razer mamba driver?

Usually, there are two ways you can get the right drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-razer-mamba-driver-easily-quickly/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 To get the latest drivers, you need to go to the[manufacturer website](http://support.razerzone.com/) , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

Here’s how:

1. Go to the [Razer support website](http://support.razerzone.com/) .
2. Click **Mice & Mats** .
