### **Option 1 –**  **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download the audio driver manually from your PC manufacturer’s website or the sound card’s website. I recommend you to check for the new driver on your PC manufacturer’s website first, as the PC manufacturers would customize the audio driver in order to provide the best performance of the device installed on their machine. If your PC manufacturer doesn’t provide the new audio driver you need, you can go to the sound card’s website to download the audio driver.

**IMPORTANT** : Before you get started, ensure that you know the model name of your PC or the model name of the sound card, and the specific operating system that your PC is running (Windows 7 64-bit or Windows 7 32-bit).
