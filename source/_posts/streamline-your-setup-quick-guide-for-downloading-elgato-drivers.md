## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

**Zebra Technologies** **Corporation** keeps updating their GK420d drivers. To get it, you need to go to the **[](https://support.hp.com/us-en) [Zebra support](https://www.zebra.cn/us/en/support-downloads/printers/desktop/gk420d.html) [](https://support.hp.com/us-en)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file (usually with the EXE extension) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
