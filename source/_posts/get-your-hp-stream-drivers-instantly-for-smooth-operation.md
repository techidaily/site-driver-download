## Get Your Samsung ADB Drivers Instantly Here

If you’re developing an application for the Android platform, you may need to install Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and the driver for it. And if you’re using a Samsung Android cellphone, you should install the Samsung ADB driver.

## To install the Samsung ADB driver on your computer

There are two ways you can use to install the Samsung ADB driver on your computer:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some patience to install the driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/samsung-adb-driver-download/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

### **Option 1 –**  **Download and install the driver manually**

To get the ADB driver , you need to go to the **[Samsung](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F)**  website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows 10 (32 or 64 bit) and download the driver manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### **Option 2 –  Automatically update the ADB driver**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the ADB driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks(and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.**2)**Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now**button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**Click the**Update** button next to the ADB driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
