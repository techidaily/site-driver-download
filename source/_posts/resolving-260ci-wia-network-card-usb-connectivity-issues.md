## Seamless Connectivity with Newest TP-Link TUSB400 Bluetooth Adapter Drivers – Download Here

Device drivers allow your devices to work properly on your computer. And the latest driver keeps your**TP-Link Bluetooth adapter** in great condition while making the most out of the hardware.

 There are two ways you can install or update the TP-Link Bluetooth adapter driver:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/tp-link-bluetooth-adapter-driver-download-update/#option2)**  – You don’t need to be tech-savvy to keep your drivers up to date. All you need are a few clicks and a computer with Internet.

**OR**

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This requires some computer knowledge. You need to visit the official website and search for your model. Then download the wizard that needs additional configuration during installation.

## Option 1: Install or update your driver automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Bluetooth driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact Bluetooth adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
