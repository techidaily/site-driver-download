## Upgrade Your Gaming Experience with a Speedy GTX 1660 Graphics Driver Overhaul

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-572.png)

 Are you a PC gamer who cares most about visual experience but feels reluctant to fiddle with all the driver updating stuff? If the answer is yes, and you’re also using the**GTX 1660** graphics card, then you’ve come to the right place. As Nvidia keeps updating its GTX 1660 drivers, you should keep up with it in order to get the most out of your graphics card.

## How to update your GTX 1660 driver

There are mainly two ways you can update the driver :

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-gtx-1660-driver-quickly-easily/#option1) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 Both options work for Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows 7.

### Option 1: Update your driver automatically (Recommended)

 Some people may find it hard to locate the correct version of GTX 1660 drivers online. And even if you successfully find it, it’s still time-consuming and error-prone to install the driver. So if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your GTX 1660 driver manually,   **you can do it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and Install Driver Easy.
