## Way 1\. Download the driver from Wacom website manually

 To get the latest device drivers, the direct way is to download from its manufacturer’s website. Wacom Intuos Pro driver is no exception.

 Go to the[Wacom Support website](http://www.wacom.com/en-us/support/product-support/drivers) and find the latest driver for your Intuos Pro model number. Then click**DOWNLOAD** to get the driver.

 When it completes downloading, double-click the downloaded driver file to install it on your computer.

 Although downloading the driver from Wacom’s official website is direct and straightforward, it’s not such easy as it is shown and it can be time-consuming.

 Note: If you have no time, no patience or you don’t have the computer skill to find and download the correct driver manually, follow way 2 to let Driver Easy help you then.

## Way 2\. Download & Install the driver automatically

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a 100% safe and super helpful driver tool. It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. With its help, you can say goodbye to driver headaches and delays forever.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3) With Free version: Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged Wacom tablet driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.

With Pro version: click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.
