## Upgrade Your Gaming Experience with a Speedy GTX 1660 Graphics Driver Overhaul

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-572.png)

 Are you a PC gamer who cares most about visual experience but feels reluctant to fiddle with all the driver updating stuff? If the answer is yes, and you’re also using the**GTX 1660** graphics card, then you’ve come to the right place. As Nvidia keeps updating its GTX 1660 drivers, you should keep up with it in order to get the most out of your graphics card.

## How to update your GTX 1660 driver

There are mainly two ways you can update the driver :

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-gtx-1660-driver-quickly-easily/#option1) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 Both options work for Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows 7.
