## Quick Download: Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 Drivers - Get Set Up Fast

If you have a Microsoft wireless mouse or just bought it but found it didn’t function properly, you may need to update the driver to fix it. Don’t worry, this post is going to show you how to update driver and set up as you want.

## Why you need Microsoft wireless mouse 5000 drivers?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.

## How to download Microsoft wireless mouse 5000 drivers?

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-microsoft-wireless-mouse-5000-driver-easily-quickly/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You need to go to[Microsoft official website](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/d/wireless-mouse-5000) to search for the model.  
 Select the operating system you’re using and download the correct driver for your keyboard. Download and install it manually.
