## Why should I keep my drivers up-to-date

 Drivers play an important part in your Windows computer. When you encounter computer issues, you need to put drivers into consideration.

Why?

 Because drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why most of the problems can be solved by installing/updating drivers.
