If you want to keep your Epson WF-2750 printer in good condition, or if you want to fix its driver issues, you should update your printer driver.

## To update your Epson WF-2750 printer driver

The following are two methods to update your printer driver.

1. [**Download your printer driver from the Epson website**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your printer driver automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Download your printer driver from the Epson website

You can download your Epson WF-2750 printer driver from Epson and install it on your own. To do so:**1)**Go to the **[Epson official website](https://epson.com/usa)**  and search “_wf 2750_“.

**2)** Go to your printer support page, then download the correct and latest driver to your computer.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

**3)**Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.

### Method 2: Update your printer driver automatically

If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . **Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee** ): **1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** . **2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to_EPSON WF-2750 Series_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
