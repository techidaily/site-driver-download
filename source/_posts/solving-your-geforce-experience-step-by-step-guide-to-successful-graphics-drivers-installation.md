##  1\. Update the NVIDIA driver manually or automatically

 When GeForce Experience fails to download the driver for your display card, and a second try doesn’t help, you can try to update the Nvidia display card driver manually instead.

 To update the Nvidia display card driver manually, go to the[**Nvidia driver download page**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) and select the correct product and operating system version for your graphics card. Be sure to select the correct driver that works for your computer.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the Nvidia display card driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.** 

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  
    
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation.

4. Restart your computer for the change to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

##  2\. Close unnecessary programs

 GPU monitoring programs such as EVGA Precision X and MSI Afterburner could affect the driver download and installation process in GeForce Experience and therefore cause problems like_**Driver download failed**_ . So you can try to close such monitoring programs if you have them running in the background. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and**X** at the same time to select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-42.png)
2. Select the GPU monitoring programs you have running in the background (like the ones for tuning, overclocking, fan control, etc.) and click**End Task** to close them one by one.

##  3\. Try a clean NVIDIA driver installation

 If the above two methods don’t help to fix the Driver download failed issue in GeForce Experience, it’s possible that some older driver files are causing stability and performance issues with the app. In that case, you should try to do a clean reinstallation of the Nvidia display driver. To do so, DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) is usually recommended, as it can do a pretty good job removing all the older or faulty display driver files on your computer.

To do a clean reinstallation of the display card driver with DDU:

1. Download and search for the execution file of the display card driver from **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
2. Download DDU from the[**official download page**](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) . Then unzip the folder, and double-click the**DDU** file to further extract the execution file.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ddu-3.png)
3. Boot your computer into Safe Mode as instructed here:[**Start Safe Mode using the System Configuration tool**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

5. Select **GPU** and **your GPU manufacturer** on the right side. Then click **Clean and restart** .

##  4\. Allow GeForce Experience in Windows firewall

 As mentioned above, monitoring programs could affect the driver download and installation process in GeForce Experience, and third-party antivirus programs and Windows firewall falls under such category as well.

 In this case, you can try to add GeForce Experience to your third-party antivirus programs and Windows firewall’s exception list. The exact procedure to do the former differs for different programs, seek help from the program developers if needed.

To add GeForce Experience to your Windows firewall exception list:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and the**R** key simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **control firewall.cpl**  and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-44.png)
3. From the left navigation pane, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-46.png)
