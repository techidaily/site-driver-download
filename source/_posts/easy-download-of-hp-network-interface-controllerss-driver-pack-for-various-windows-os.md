## Get Your Speakers Working on Windows Asterisk 7 - Driver Downloads Available Here

Updating audio drivers can your Windows 7 no sound issues. There’re two ways you can download new audio drivers for your Windows 7: manually and automatically

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-audio-drivers-for-windows-7/#option2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –**  **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download the audio driver manually from your PC manufacturer’s website or the sound card’s website. I recommend you to check for the new driver on your PC manufacturer’s website first, as the PC manufacturers would customize the audio driver in order to provide the best performance of the device installed on their machine. If your PC manufacturer doesn’t provide the new audio driver you need, you can go to the sound card’s website to download the audio driver.

**IMPORTANT** : Before you get started, ensure that you know the model name of your PC or the model name of the sound card, and the specific operating system that your PC is running (Windows 7 64-bit or Windows 7 32-bit).

### **Option 2 –  Automatically update the audio drivers in Windows 7**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Windows 7 audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just**2** clicks  (and**you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** ) :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the audio driver (for example, Realtek High Definition Audio) to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
