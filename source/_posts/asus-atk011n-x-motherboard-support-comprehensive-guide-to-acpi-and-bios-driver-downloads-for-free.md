 The Logitech K400 Plus driver runs on your computer, and enables it to communicate with the wireless keyboard you use. Your device wonâ€™t fully function if the driver hasnâ€™t been properly installed on your computer.

 So, if youâ€™re using a Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 Plus and itâ€™s not working properly now, updating its driver should always be your go-to option.

 There are two ways you can get the latest correct Logitech K400 Plus driver:

* **[Option 1 â€“ Automatically update the Logitech K400 driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-logitech-k400-plus-driver-issues/#a)**
* **[Option 2 â€“ Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
