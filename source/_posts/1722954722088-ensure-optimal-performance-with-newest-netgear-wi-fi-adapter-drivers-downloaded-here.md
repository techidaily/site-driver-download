 To make sure your Wi-Fi connection is in good condition, you should keep your wireless adapter driver up to date. In this post, we’ll tell you how to download and update your NETGEAR wireless adapter driver easily and quickly.

## How to update the NETGEAR Wi-Fi adapter driver

 There are mainly two ways to update your NETGEAR wireless adapter driver, and you can choose the one you prefer.

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/netgear-wireless-adapter-driver-download-update/#Option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download and install it step by step.
