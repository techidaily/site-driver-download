## To download and install the latest driver

There are two ways you can do this:**Download and install your drivers manually**– You can update the printer driver manually by going to the **[Epson website](https://epson.com/usa)** , and searching for the latest driver for your printer. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

or

**Download and install your drivers automatically**– If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your printer driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .
