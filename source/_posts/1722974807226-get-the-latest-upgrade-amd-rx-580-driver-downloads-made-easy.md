## 3 Options To Update AMD RX580 Drivers In Windows

 Here’re 3 options for you to update your AMD RX580 driver; just choose the way you prefer:

1. **[Update AMD RX 580 driver via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update AMD RX 580 driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update AMD RX 580 driver automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 1: Update**AMD RX 580**  driver via Device Manager

 Device Manager is surely a quick way to update drivers because Windows can help us find the right driver and save us a lot time in finding one. But there’s one niggle: it doesn’t necessarily have the latest version available. Still, let’s give it a go:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .
