If you have a **GS65 Stealth Thin 8RF** laptop, and you have driver issue such as the missing or outdated motherboard driver, don’t worry. There are solutions to fix it.

## Why you need MSI GS65 drivers?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.
