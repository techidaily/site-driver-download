**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your laptopâ€™s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

 To manually update your**Synaptics** drivers:

 First you might need to head to your laptopâ€™s manufacturerâ€™s official website(i.e. the OEM website,like Dell, ASUS etc.) and search the drivers available for your product model. Then  be sure to**ONLY** choose the driver package corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually.

 Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
