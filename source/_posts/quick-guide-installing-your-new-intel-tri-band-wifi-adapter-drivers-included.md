## Why should I update the Acer audio driver

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is a printer, video card, or audio output device. By rolling out new drivers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) improve the functionality of their products and correct technical issues reported by users. Therefore, if you ever encounter any issues relating to audio (such as no sound on Acer computer), try to update the audio driver and see whether that gets you out of trouble.
