 If you have a Canon PIXMA Professional Inkjet printer: PIXMA PRO-100, you should install a driver for your printer to work flawlessly in your Windows computer. This post shows you how to download and install**Canon PIXMA Pro 100 drivers** for Windows 10, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.

 Updating your printer driver can bring you the best possible experience and resolve issues like printer not printing or printer offline.

There are two ways you can update your Canon PIXMA Pro 100 driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually:](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (recommended):](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/canon-pixma-pro-100-driver-download-and-update-in-windows-10-7-and-8-1/#option2)**  This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 As a printer manufacturer, Canon provides printer drivers for their products on the website. To get the Canon PIXMA Pro 100 driver:

 1) Go to the **[Canon Support center](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home)**  , and click**Support** \>**Drivers & Downloads** .
