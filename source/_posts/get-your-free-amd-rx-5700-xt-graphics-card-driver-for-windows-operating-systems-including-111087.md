 If you randomly run into performance issues with your AMD RX 5700 XT card such as poor monitor resolution, strange blue screen, game crashing, or low FPS, it’s time to update your GPU driver.

 In this post, you’ll learn two ways to download and install the latest AMD RX 5700 XT driver on Windows 11, 10, 8 and 7\. You could choose either one that suits your needs.

**[Option 1 – Automatically (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/amd-rx-5700-xt-driver-download/#option1)**

[**Option 2 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Option 1 – Automatically download and install RX 5700 XT driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to search for the right RX 5700 XT driver online and install it manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
