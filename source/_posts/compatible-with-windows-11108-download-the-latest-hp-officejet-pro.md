## Fix 2 – Update your Brother HL 2280DW driver

 Printer manufacturers regularly release new drivers to fix bugs and improve stability. If re-enabling the device doesn’t resolve your issue, you should consider updating the driver. There are two ways to do this:

1. **[Automatically (recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-brother-hl-2280dw-driver-issues/#option1)**
2. **[Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

---

### Option 1 – Automatically (recommended)

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged Brother HL-2280DW driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

### Option 2 – Manually

 If you just want to do everything by yourself, you can search for the latest driver of your printer model from Brother’s official website, and then install it manually.

**1)** Go to the[**Brother support website**](https://support.brother.com/g/b/productsearch.aspx?c=us%5Fot&lang=en&content=dl) . Type**Brother HL 2280DW** in the search box, and click**Search** .
