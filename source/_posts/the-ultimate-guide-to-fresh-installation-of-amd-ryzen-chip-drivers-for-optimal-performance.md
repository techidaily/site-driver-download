![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_5785fb1427b5c.png) When you find yourself in one of the following situations with your**Dell 2330d**or**2330dn**printer, you might need to consider installing or updating the printer driver:

* You are having problem installing your printer
* Your printer was not automatically installed when you connected it to your computer and turned it on
* You are getting a printer error message
This post describes two methods as to how to download and install the latest printer driver. Hope you find it helpful. **Method One: Dell Support**Before you start, you need to know the**operating system**of your computer. This tutorial is done on a computer with Windows 7, 64-bit operating system, please check your OS beforehand. 1) Go to Dell support. In the middle part of the page, either enter your product ID or service tag on the searching box, or choose**View products**if you don’t know the above information about your printer. In this tutorial, we choose**View products**.
