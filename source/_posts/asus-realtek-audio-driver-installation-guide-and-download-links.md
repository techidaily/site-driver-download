## Quick and Easy Installation of Razer Mamba Drivers - Download Now

**Razer mamba gaming mouse** is a very popular choice for game players. To make your Razer mamba mouse work properly, you’re recommended to keep its driver software up-to-date.

## Why you need the Razer mamba driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR
