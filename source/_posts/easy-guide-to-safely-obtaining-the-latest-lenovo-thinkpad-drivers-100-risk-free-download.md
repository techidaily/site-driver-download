 4) When the uninstall finishes, restart your computer.
  
 5) If your computer doesn’t prompt to help you install the new driver when you restart it, you need to do it by yourself.
  
 Still, go back to**Device Manager** . This time, click the icon for **Scan for hardware changes** . Windows will help you detect the change and then install the new driver for you.
