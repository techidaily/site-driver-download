## Easy Troubleshooting and Installation of the Dell Mouse Driver - Solved

Update your Dell mouse driver is a useful way to solve your mouse issues. This post will show you how to do it.

## Why you need to update your Dell mouse driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.
