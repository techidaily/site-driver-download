### Method 1: Download or update Zebra printer drivers manually

 You can download the driver for your printer from the Zebra website, and manually install it in your computer.

 Before starting, you should know the printer model and the operating system running in your computer.

1. Go to **[Zebra support center](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads.html)**  .
2. Search for your printer model. You can search it from the search box by entering the printer model, or you can do it by navigating to the product list.

5. Run the downloaded file, and follow the wizard to finish installing.

This method requires time and computer skill.

 If this solution doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. There are something else to try.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you’ll get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ).

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the**Free** version). Then install the driver in your computer.  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
