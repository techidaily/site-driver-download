### **Option 1 â€“ Update your ScanSnap driver manually**

 Fujitsu keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to Fujitsuâ€™s official  website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once youâ€™ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
