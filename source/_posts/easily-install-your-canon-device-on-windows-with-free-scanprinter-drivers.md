## Option 1 â€“ Download and install the driver manually

 Konica Minolta keeps updating drivers for its series of printers. You can go to its website, find the latest driver that corresponds with your operating system, and then download it. This process is a little time-consuming and error-prone, but weâ€™ll show you how to do this step by step.

**1)** Go to **[Konica Minoltaâ€™s download center](https://www.konicaminolta.eu/eu-en/support/download-centre)**  .

**2)** Select your product model.
