## Easy Driver Downloads for Acer Predator XB271HU - Get Them Now

If you have**the Acer Predator XB271HU monitor** and looking for its driver, you’ve come to the right place! This post will show you how to download Acer Predator XB271HU drivers easily and quickly.

## Why you need Acer Predator XB271HU drivers?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.

## How to update Acer Predator XB271HU drivers?

 It is very important to update your device drivers to prevent potential problems. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter issues like blue screen, black screen or white screen error. So it’s really important to keep your drivers update.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-acer-predator-xb271hu-drivers-quickly-easily/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download device drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
