## Find & Install Your New Sound Card Driver on Windows PCs Easily

Keeping your **sound card driver**up to date can help your sound card work properly. You should regularly check this driver and make sure it’s updated

## To update your sound card driver

There are two ways you can update your sound card driver:[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)– You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/sound-card-drivers-download-for-windows/#b)– This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

To get your sound card driver, you need to go to the official website of your sound card manufacturer, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update the sound card driver

If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the sound card driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

You can also click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the driver that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
