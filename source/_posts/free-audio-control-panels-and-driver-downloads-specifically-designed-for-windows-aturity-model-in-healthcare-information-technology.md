## Free Audio Control Panels & Driver Downloads Specifically Designed for Windows Aturity Model in Healthcare Information Technology

Updating audio drivers can your Windows 7 no sound issues. There’re two ways you can download new audio drivers for your Windows 7: manually and automatically

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-audio-drivers-for-windows-7/#option2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –**  **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download the audio driver manually from your PC manufacturer’s website or the sound card’s website. I recommend you to check for the new driver on your PC manufacturer’s website first, as the PC manufacturers would customize the audio driver in order to provide the best performance of the device installed on their machine. If your PC manufacturer doesn’t provide the new audio driver you need, you can go to the sound card’s website to download the audio driver.

**IMPORTANT** : Before you get started, ensure that you know the model name of your PC or the model name of the sound card, and the specific operating system that your PC is running (Windows 7 64-bit or Windows 7 32-bit).

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
