 If you want to keep your Logitech G933 gaming headset in good condition, or if you’re having an issue with your headset and you’re trying to fix it, updating its driver is always an option you should go for.

#### There are two ways to update your G933 driver

[**Option 1** **– Manually:**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) You can download and install the update for your driver yourself. This requires some time, patience, and sometimes even computer skills

OR

[**Option 2** **– Automatically (Recommended):**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/logitech-g933-headset-latest-driver-download/#auto) This is the quicker and easier option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

##  Option 1: Download and install your driver manually

 You can download and install the latest driver for your Logitech G933 headset on your own. To do so, you should go to the **[official website of Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-us)**  and search “G933” for its support page, where Logitech releases drivers and software for your headset. You need to download the correct and latest driver to your computer.

 You should download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

 Then open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.

##  Option 2: Update your driver automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .
