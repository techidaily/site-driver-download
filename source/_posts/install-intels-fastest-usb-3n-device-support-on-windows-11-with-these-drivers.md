 Want to download and update the Intel Iris Plus Graphics 655 driver on your computer? You’ve come to the right place! In this post, we’ll show you two easy ways to download and install the driver.

## Two ways to update your driver

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/intel-iris-plus-graphics-655-driver-download-update/#Option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
