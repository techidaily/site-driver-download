## About **Asus VG248QE driver**

 In fact, ASUS’s official website doesn’t provide a monitor driver for our **Asus VG248QE** gaming monitor simply because it doesn’t need one. Like most typical monitors, our **Asus VG248QE** gaming monitor is perfectly compatible with our computer and doesn’t need a separate monitor driver to have the designated viewing effects.

 But if you are running into problems like   **Asus VG248QE showing as generic PnP monitor**  and**no 144hz** , as many users have reported, it’s highly recommended you**update your graphics driver** for the best performance of your monitor.
