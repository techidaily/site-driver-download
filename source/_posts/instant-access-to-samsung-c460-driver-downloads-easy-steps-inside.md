 If you have a **Samsung C460 Laser Multifunction printer** in your office, but it isn’t working as you expect, you may need to update its the Samsung C460 drivers.  
 This post will lead you to download the right driver for your device.

## Why you need Samsung C460 drivers?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why when you meet problems, you need to download the related driver to solve it.

## How to download the Samsung C460 driver?

OR

**[Option 2 – Automaticall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [y](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[(Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
