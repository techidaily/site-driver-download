## Quick Fix for Acer Speaker Issues? Mastering the Driver Update Tutorial

Not sure where to find the latest audio/sound driver for your Acer computer? Then look no further: in this post, you’ll have two ways to download and install the driver efficiently.

## Why should I update the Acer audio driver

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is a printer, video card, or audio output device. By rolling out new drivers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) improve the functionality of their products and correct technical issues reported by users. Therefore, if you ever encounter any issues relating to audio (such as no sound on Acer computer), try to update the audio driver and see whether that gets you out of trouble.

## How to update the Acer audio driver

To update the Acer audio driver, you have two options:

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/update-acer-audio-driver-quickly-easily/#option1)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

OR

**[Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
