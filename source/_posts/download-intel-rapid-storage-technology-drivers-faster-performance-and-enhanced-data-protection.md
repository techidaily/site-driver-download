 RAID stands for**Redundant Array of Independent Disks** , or**Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks** . It is created to combine multiple, less expensive drives into a single, higher-capacity and/or faster volume.

 To put it in a simpler term, RAID is very useful if you want to keep the data in your drives safe even when you are having some sort of hardware failure. You may see RAID 0, RAID 1 or RAID 5 somewhere in your computer’s disk section, the different numbers show the different levels, or methods by which the drives are gathered together.
  
 If RAID suddenly stops working, you will find that you are unable to read certain information from your disks, and there is also a possibility that your data cannot be recovered unless you pay a lot for it.
  
 If this is happening to you, you should first consider getting the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver updated, which could be a hard work to some.
