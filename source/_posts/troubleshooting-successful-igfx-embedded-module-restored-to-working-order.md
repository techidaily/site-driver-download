5. Depending on whether Windows provides you a driver update:  
   * If **yes** , then follow the on-screen instructions to update the driver and skip the rest of the steps. Then restart your computer for the changes to take effect.  
   * If **no** , and instead you got the message **The best drivers for your device already installed** , then you might have to continue with the following steps.**CLEARLY** the message isn’t true and Windows can fail its job in keeping up with the manufacturer’s latest graphics drivers (**hence the error igfxEM Module has stopped working** ).
