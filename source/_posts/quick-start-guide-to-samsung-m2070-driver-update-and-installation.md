## Why should I update the Samsung M2070 driver

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is a printer, video card, or audio output device.

Therefore, when you encounter a problem with your Samsung M2070 printer (such as[printer not connected](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), try updating the corresponding driver and see whether that gets you out of trouble. Or if you just want your printer to work in tip-top condition, it’s also wise of you to update the driver.
