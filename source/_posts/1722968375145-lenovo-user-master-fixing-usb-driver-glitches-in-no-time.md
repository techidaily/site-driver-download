## Lenovo User? Master Fixing USB Driver Glitches in No Time

Having issues with your**Lenovo USB driver**? Your USB connection is not working properly? You’re not alone. Many Lenovo users have had the same issue occurring on their computer. But don’t worry. You can fix these issues by updating your USB driver.

## There are two ways to update your Lenovo USB driver

2. [**Update your USB driver automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This is the quicker and easier option. It requires just a couple of mouse clicks!

### Method 1: Update your USB driver manually

To update your USB driver, you should get your USB driver update from the Lenovo’s official website, then install it on your own. **1)**Go to the **[Lenovo official website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww3.lenovo.com%2F)**  and search your computer model.

**2)** Go to the driver download page of your product, then download the correct and latest USB drivers to your computer.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

**3)**Open the downloaded driver and follow the on-screen instructions to install them on your computer.
