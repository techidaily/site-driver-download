## Why should I update the Scansnap S1100 driver

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is an image scanner, video card, or audio output device. By rolling out new drivers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) improve the functionality of their products and correct technical issues reported by users. Therefore, if you ever encounter any problems relating to your scanner (e.g. the device stops working), try to update the corresponding driver and see whether that gets you out of trouble.
