### Method 1: Download and update SAS driver manually

You can download the SAS driver from the manufacturer website, but this takes time and computer skills. We recommend this method if you’re confident with your computer skills. The driver varies from model to model, so you should go to your device manufacturer’s website and fins the correct driver. Below shows the general steps:

1. Go to the website of your device manufacturer, for example, you can go to**Intel** or**Broadcom** .
2. Go to the support page and search for your device driver**.**
3. Find the latest version for your device, and make sure to choose the one that is compatible with your OS.
4. Run the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to finish.
If this method doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. You can try the next solution.
