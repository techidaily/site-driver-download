If you want to keep your Epson WF-2750 printer in good condition, or if you want to fix its driver issues, you should update your printer driver.

## To update your Epson WF-2750 printer driver

The following are two methods to update your printer driver.

1. [**Download your printer driver from the Epson website**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your printer driver automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Download your printer driver from the Epson website

**2)** Go to your printer support page, then download the correct and latest driver to your computer.
