![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc0191bb217e.jpg)

 Use**Driver Easy** to download & update Microsoft drivers on your Windows 10/8/7 and solve problem driver induced issues you’re having on your PC.

 Did you just update your Windows only to find sound is missing from your computer?

 You must be searching the Internet upside down for an easy and reliable**Microsoft driver** download and update.

But don’t worry – you’re safe in our hands!

## Choose the way you prefer

 Here’re two ways for you to **download & update the Microsoft drivers on your Windows 10/8/7** . Just browse through the list and take your pick:

1. [**Update your Microsoft drivers manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your Microsoft drivers automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/microsoft-driver-download-update-in-windows-10-8-7-easily/#O2)

### Option 1: Update your Microsoft drivers manually

**WARNING**  : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. And unless you know the exactly model of the hardware in need of a driver update & the variant of your Windows Operating System, it can present certain levels of difficulty.

So here’re we go:

1. Go to the manufacturer’s official website.
2. Check out the **Support**   section for **driver downloads** , then type in**the model of the hardware piece** you want a driver update with and search.
3. Among the driver releases, make sure to**ONLY** choose drivers that are both most up-to-date and compatible with **your variant of Windows Operating System** .
4. Double-click on the downloaded file and run the wizard to finish the install step by step.
5. **Restart** your computer for the changes to take effect.

### Option 2: Update your Microsoft drivers automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Microsoft drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either **[the FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
