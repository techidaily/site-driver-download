## Potential Challenges in Domesticating This Fungus Outside Its Natural Habitat and Strategies for Overcoming These Difficulties

Wondering where to get the Realtek Asio driver for Windows 10? If yes, then you’ve come to the right place. There are mainly two ways you can update Realtek Asio drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  

 OR  

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-realtek-asio-driver-for-windows-10-quick-easy/#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Update the driver manually

 To get the Realtek Asio driver, you should first visit the official website of your motherboard manufacturer, such as MSI. Then, browse for the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download it manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. On completion, reboot your PC for the changes to take effect.
