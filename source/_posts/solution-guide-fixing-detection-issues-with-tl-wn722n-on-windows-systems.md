![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-122.png)

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you have any problems using Driver Easy to update your driver, please feel free to email us at **<support@drivereasy.com>** . We are always here to help.

**Option 1** can be applied to all versions of Windows. Still, if you opt to download and update your Ralink RT3290 driver manually, please read on and try Option 2 (it only works for Windows 8 and Windows 7).

### **Option 2: Download and update your Ralink RT3290 driver manually (For Windows 8/7 Only)**

 Ralink Technology, Corp. was acquired by MediaTek in 2011, so you can no longer find the official website of Ralink. But luckily, the driver can still be found in **[mediatek.com](https://www.mediatek.com/) .**

 To find out the correct driver, you should first get to know some basic information about your operating system. If you do know it, simply skip to Step 3; If you don’t, then read on.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to fire up the**Run** box. Type**msinfo32** and click**OK** .

 2) In the**System Information** window, on the**System Summary** tab, you’ll see the overall information about your PC. Take note of these two items:**OS Name** and**System Type** . The combination of the two shows exactly what version of Windows you have.

 For example, this is a screenshot of Windows 8.1 Pro (64-bit). And there’s one thing you should know: regarding**System Type** , “x64-based PC” stands for the 64-bit version; in contrast, “x86-based PC” stands for 32-bit.

 3) After knowing the version of your Windows operating system, you should now search for the driver online. You can either find your own way to the official website of MediaTek, or you can simply click[https://www.mediatek.com/](https://www.mediatek.com/) .

 4) There’s a search bar at the top of the website. Type**RT3290** , and then hit**Enter** on your keyboard.

 5) Find**RT3290** and click**Read More** .

 6) Click on the small blue icon below**Download Drivers** .

 7) Wait for the download process to complete, then navigate to the file you’ve just downloaded.

 8) Open that file and double-click**Disk 1 > drivers** . If you’re using Windows 7, then go on to double-click**Win7** ; if you’re using Windows 8, then double-click**Win8** instead.

 Unfortunately MediaTek doesn’t provide the corresponding driver for Windows 10, so if you’re using Windows 10, please turn to **[Option 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 9) Make sure you open the right files based on your Windows version. In the end, you’ll see a file as illustrated below.
