### Option 1 – Update the drivers manually

 Lenovo keeps updating drivers for the T450 laptops. To get them, you need to visit the support website of Lenovo, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10, 64 bit) and download the drivers manually. Here’s the details:

1. Go to the **[Drivers & Software page](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpcsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fthinkpad-t-series-laptops%2Fthinkpad-t450%2Fdownloads%2Fdriver-list%2F) [](https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-MAXIMUS-X-HERO/HelpDesk%5FDownload/)**  of Lenovo T450 laptops.
2. Under the**Manual Update** tab, select your operating system. You can also sort the drivers by**Components** ,**Severity** , and**Release Date** if you want.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-27_19-12-26.jpg)
3. Below you’ll be presented with a slew of component categories. Click the one whose drivers you need to update.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-27_19-21-12.jpg)
4. Take the audio driver as an example. Click**Audio** and then you’ll see one or more drivers available for download on the pop-up page. Once you find the one you’d like to download, simply click the down arrow button which represents “Download.”

5. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
6. **Reboot** your computer for the changes to take effect even if you’re not asked to.

 Repeat Step 3 through Step 6 until you finish downloading and installing all the drivers you need. This may seem a bit time-consuming and error-prone, though. If you’re interested in the benefits of updating drivers automatically with a driver updater tool, read on and find out how.
