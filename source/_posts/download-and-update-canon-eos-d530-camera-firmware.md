## Sound Drivers Download and Update. Easily

If you want to update the sound driver to fix computer no sound issues, you can use one of the methods below to update the sound driver. We’ve put together two methods here to update the sound drivers; just pick the easier one for you. All steps below apply to Windows 10, 8.1 & 7.

**[Method 1: Download and update the audio drivers manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
**[Method 2: Download and update the audio drivers automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Method 1: Download and update the audio drivers manually

 Windows can provide new drivers through Device Manager. Device Manager is a Windows utility where you can manage the device and the drivers. In Device Manager, you can update the drivers, uninstall the drivers, disable the device, etc. So when you have sound driver issues, you can update the driver via Device Manager.

 To update the sound driver in Device Manager, here’s what you need to do:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** in the run box and click the**OK** button to open Device Manager.

### Method 2: Download and update the audio drivers automatically

 If you can’t update the sound driver successfully via Device Manager, or if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will scan your computer to detect any problem drivers in your computer. You don’t need to know what operating system your computer is running. You can update the Realtek audio driver automatically with the Free or the Pro version of Driver Easy.   **But with the Pro version it just takes 2 clicks (and you get full support and 30-day refund guarantee** ).

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Launch Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will detect all problem drivers instantly and provide you with new drivers.
