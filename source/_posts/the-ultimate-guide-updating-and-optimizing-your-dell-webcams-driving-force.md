 **Seeing a yellow warning icon next to RNDIS in Device Manager?** Don’t worry… Although it’s incredibly frustrating, you’re definitely not the only person to experience this problem. Many Windows users have reported the very same issue. More importantly, you should be able to fix it pretty easily…

## What is RNDIS?

 **RNDIS is short for “Remote Network Driver Interface Specification”** . It is a Microsoft proprietary protocol, which is often used on top of USB. As a protocol, RNDIS provides a virtual Ethernet link to most versions of the Windows, Linux,**Android** and FreeBSD operating systems.

 If a yellow warning icon appears next to it, it indicates that Windows has identified a problem with it. In most cases, this issue can be fixed after you reinstall or update its driver.

### **There are two methods to update RNDIS driver:**

 You can do it manually or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Method 1: Manually.**  You can update RNDIS driver manually in Device Manager. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run dialog. Then type **devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

4. Follow the on-screen instruction to continue.

 If Windows find the updated RNDIS driver for you, follow its instruction to install it on your PC. If not, try the next fix, below.

 **Method 2: Automatically.**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to download and update RNDIS driver manually, or if Windows did find the updated driver for you, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**  You don’t need to know exactly what system your PC is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .
