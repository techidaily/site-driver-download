## Newest Firmware for Your AMD Radeon RX ([Email Protected]) XT - Download Now

It’s important to keep your**AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics driver** up to date, especially when you notice that your computer is slower than before, or when you’re suffering from games crashing, stuttering, and even screen flickering issues.

 By updating your graphics driver, you’ll unlock the full potential of your graphics card and give you an edge in PC video games.

 In this tutorial, you’ll learn 2 easy ways to download and install the latest AMD RX 6700 XT graphics driver on your windows computer.

## 2 ways to update the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics driver

 Here’re 2 options for you to update your graphics driver; just choose the way you prefer:

1. [Update AMD RX 6700 XT graphics driver**manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update AMD RX 6700 XT graphics driver**automatically (recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/latest-amd-rx-6700-xt-driver-download-for-windows/#h-option-2-automatically-update-the-amd-rx-6700-xt-graphics-driver)

### Option 1 – Download and install the latest graphics driver manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 AMD keeps updating new drivers for its graphics cards. If you’d like to update the graphics driver by yourself, carefully follow the steps below:

1. Go to **[AMD’s support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  .
2. Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64-bit) and download the driver manually.
3. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 Manually updating drivers is a bit time-consuming and error-prone. If you prefer a simpler method, check out the second option below.
