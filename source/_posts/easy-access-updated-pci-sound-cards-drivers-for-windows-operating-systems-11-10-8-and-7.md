 Got a shiny new AMD RX 6800 graphics card and expect an ultimate gaming experience and flawless graphics display? If so, you need to keep your GPU driver up-to-date at all times. In this tutorial, you’ll explore two safe ways to update the AMD RX 6800 driver easily:

**[Method 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 You need to find the exactly right driver online, download it, and install it step by step, which may require some computer skills and patience.

OR

**[Method 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/amd-rx-6800-driver-download-for-windows/#method2)**

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Method 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 To check for any updates of the AMD Radeon RX 6800 driver, you can head towards the download page of AMD, where new drivers are regularly rolled out for general improvement and bug fixes.

If you have no idea how to do this, simply follow the steps below.

1. Visit **[AMD’s support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  .
2. Scroll down to the search section, and choose**Graphics** \>**AMD Radeon 6000 Series** \>**AMD Radeon 6800 Series** \>**AMD Radeon 6800** . Then, click**Submit** .

5. Reboot your computer for the changes to take effect.

 If the process of manual driver update is too complex for you, there is an easier option below.
