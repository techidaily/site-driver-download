## Quick-Start Guide for the Latest Wacom Intuos Tablet Drivers – Plug and Play

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-142.png)

 Wondering how to update your Wacom Intuos Draw driver? If the answer is “yes,” then you’ve come to the right place. Now read on and find the solution that you’re most comfortable with.

## Why should I update drivers

 Driver, unlike its name, plays the role as a translator between hardware devices and the operating system (OS). Without drivers, your devices won’t understand the commands from Windows, thereby failing to work properly. To get them started, drivers “translate” the language of Windows into instructions your hardware can understand. Although most drivers come packed up with Windows, they’re developed by the device manufacturers, not Microsoft. So when Microsoft changes the way Windows talks to your devices, you’ll suddenly get all kinds of errors including Blue Screen of Death, devices not working, etc. because your drivers won’t be able to translate the new commands.

 Back to the Wacom Intuos Draw driver you’re looking for. Undoubtedly, updating this driver can do you good in various aspects, such as securing the stability of your Wacom tablet, tackling the device-not-working issue, and fixing many other glitches that you might confront. In a nutshell, keep updating your drivers to get the devices in tip-top condition.

## How can I update the Wacom Intuos Draw driver

There are mainly two ways you can update the Wacom Intuos Draw driver :

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.  

 OR  

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
