You have checked the status of your camera and the wiring condition trying to find out the problem, but everything looks fine. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/img_5786108601dad.png)That leaves you one possible cause, outdated camera driver. Here is a post showing you how you could update your Lenovo integrated camera in three different ways, please choose accordingly. **Ways to Update Lenovo Integrated Camera Driver** **1\.

Please note that not all drivers update could be found in this way, so it is suggested that you use the following method to find the driver that you need.**2\. Lenovo Support** **Note:** Before you do this, you need to know your operating system and your laptop model. You could find your laptop model in your system information panel. Just type in**system information**in the**Start**panel and you will see it. It is always recommended that you download the drivers from the official website of the manufacturers of your PC or motherboard when you decide to download and install them manually. We are going to Lenovo support webpage for the integrated or built-in camera driver for it. Website such as[http://support.lenovo.com/us/en](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen),[http://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fsg%2Fen%2F)and[http://www.lenovo.com/ca/en/](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fca%2Fen%2F)should be able to help.
