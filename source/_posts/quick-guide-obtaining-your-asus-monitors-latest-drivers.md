![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-231.png)

 Are you trying to update your Samsung M2070 driver but not sure where to get the latest download? If yes, then you’ve come to the right place. In this post, you’ll have two ways to download and install the driver efficiently.

## Why should I update the Samsung M2070 driver

 Updating drivers is beneficial to the stability of your hardware devices, whether it is a printer, video card, or audio output device. By rolling out new drivers, original equipment manufacturers (OEM) improve the functionality of their products and correct technical issues reported by users. Therefore, when you encounter a problem with your Samsung M2070 printer (such as[printer not connected](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), try updating the corresponding driver and see whether that gets you out of trouble. Or if you just want your printer to work in tip-top condition, it’s also wise of you to update the driver.

1. Click **[here](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/samsung-xpress-sl-m2070-laser-multifunction-printer-series/16450377)**  to visit the download page of Samsung M2070 drivers.
