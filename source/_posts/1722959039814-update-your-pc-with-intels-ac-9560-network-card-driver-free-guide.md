Here’re the details (**network connectivity is required** ):

 1) Find your way to the download center of Intel, or you can click here:  
**[Downloads for Intel® 82579V Gigabit Ethernet PHY](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/52963/Intel-82579V-Gigabit-Ethernet-PHY)**

 2) After landing on the page, expand**Filter by** and select the version of your operating system.
