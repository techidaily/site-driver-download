### 2: Manual download from the manufacturerâ€™s website

 Manufacturers release updates for their graphics cards quite often. If youâ€™re looking to get the latest driver for your Sapphire graphics card, you can find it on[AMD Support page](https://www.amd.com/en/support) . Search for your product, and make sure to only download the driver thatâ€™s**compatible with your Windows Version** . Once youâ€™ve downloaded the driver, youâ€™ll need to install it manually.

### 3: Automatic update (Recommended!)
