## Why you need HP Photosmart 7520 printer drivers

 HP Photosmart 7520 printer is a powerful printer that delivers high-quality types of documents. It can double-sided printing documents, scanning, fax, and work almost silently. Perfect for business and family printing. To make it work smoothly, you’ll need to install its driver.  
 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both systems and devices are updating to catch up with the changing world, and so are drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

## How to download the HP Photosmart 7520 printer driver?

There are two ways you can update your HP Photosmart 7520 printer driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  (Recommended) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 HP printers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the [HP driver download page](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-envy-5000-all-in-one-printer-series/14095644/model/14095768) , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
