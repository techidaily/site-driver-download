5. Windows will scan for updates of the graphics driver for you, and install it if thereâ€™s any available.

Restart your PC to let the new driver take effect.

### 2: Manual download from the manufacturerâ€™s website

 Manufacturers release updates for their graphics cards quite often. If youâ€™re looking to get the latest driver for your Sapphire graphics card, you can find it on[AMD Support page](https://www.amd.com/en/support) . Search for your product, and make sure to only download the driver thatâ€™s**compatible with your Windows Version** . Once youâ€™ve downloaded the driver, youâ€™ll need to install it manually.

### 3: Automatic update (Recommended!)

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your Sapphire graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system, find the correct driver for your exact video card and your Windows version, then download and install it correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)
