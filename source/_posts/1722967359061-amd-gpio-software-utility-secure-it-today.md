## AMD GPIO Software Utility - Secure It Today

AMD is an American company provides powerful products for computers. You must know its famous graphics and processors series. You may install them on your computer. If you have an issue with your AMD products, you can simply update your AMD drivers to solve the problem.

## What is the GPIO driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 GPIO controller is controlled by the hardware vendor’s driver. A GPIO controller driver is a KMDF driver which used to manage all hardware-specific operations of the GPIO controller.

## Update AMD GPIO driver

 There are two ways you can update your **AMD GPIO** drivers:

* [Use the AMD driver auto-detect tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [Update your AMD GPIO driver automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Option 1: Use the AMD Driver Auto-detect tool

 The AMD Driver Auto-detect tool is a tool only for Windows 10/7 computers equipped with AMD Radeon discrete desktop graphics, mobile graphics, or AMD processors with Radeon graphics. This tool can auto-detect the model of AMD and the version of the Windows system, and then download and install the latest version of AMD driver for your computer. So, you can download this tool and use it to update/download your AMD drivers.

1. Go to [AMD support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support) , choose your product and click **Submit** .

3. Install it and use it to update your AMD drivers.

#### Option 2: Update your AMD GPIO driver automatically

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. It is also a convenient tool that can automatically update your AMD drivers.
