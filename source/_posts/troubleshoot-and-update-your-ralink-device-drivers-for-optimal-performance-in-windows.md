## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Hardware manufacturers keep updating drivers. To get the latest driver for your network adapter, you need to go to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and search for the latest driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
