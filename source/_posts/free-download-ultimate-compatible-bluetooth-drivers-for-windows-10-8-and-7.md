## Free Techkey Bluetooth Driver Software Compatible with Windows 10/7/8 – Download Now

Your Techkey Bluetooth dongle requires**the latest correct driver** to function properly on your computer. The adapter might not work as expected if the driver is missing, broken or outdated.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can install the latest Bluetooth driver for your Techkey dongle:

[Option 1: Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – This requires a certain level of computer knowledge. You need to use the Device Manager, or look for the correct driver on the manufacturer’s website.

OR

[**Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/download-techkey-bluetooth-adapter-driver-for-windows/#option2) – This might be the quickest and easiest way to get all the latest drivers for your computer. All you need is a few clicks.

## Option 1: Install the Techkey Bluetooth driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy user, you can try to install the driver for your Techkey Bluetooth adapter manually. To do so, follow these steps:

 The screenshots below are from Windows 10, and the method applies to Windows 8 and 7 as well.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) to invoke the Run dialog. Type or paste**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

3. Click**Search automatically for drivers** . Windows will then try to search and download the Bluetooth driver.  

 Windows usually_can’t_ find the latest driver for niche products. You might need to search for it in the manufacturer’s website, or use[Drive Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to download it automatically.
