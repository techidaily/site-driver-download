## Asus VG248QE Driver Update & Download Made Easy for Windows Users

Searching all over the Internet for your **Asus VG248QE** driver so that your monitor can have the claimed **144Hz refresh rate** ? Youâ€™ve come to the right place!

 Check out this guide and youâ€™ll be enjoying the life-like viewing experience as promised in no time! ðŸ˜‰

## About **Asus VG248QE driver**

 In fact, ASUSâ€™s official website doesnâ€™t provide a monitor driver for our **Asus VG248QE** gaming monitor simply because it doesnâ€™t need one. Like most typical monitors, our **Asus VG248QE** gaming monitor is perfectly compatible with our computer and doesnâ€™t need a separate monitor driver to have the designated viewing effects.

 But if you are running into problems like   **Asus VG248QE showing as generic PnP monitor**  and**no 144hz** , as many users have reported, itâ€™s highly recommended you**update your graphics driver** for the best performance of your monitor.

## How to update your graphics driver

 Both methods below work in**Windows 10** ,**8.1** and**7** . You donâ€™t have to try both, just browse through the list and take your pick:
