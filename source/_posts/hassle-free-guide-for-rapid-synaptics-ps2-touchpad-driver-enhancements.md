## Option 2: Manually update your Synaptics PS/2 Port Touchpad driver

 If you feel like updating your Synaptics PS/2 Port Touchpad driver manually, here’s the simple and useful guide for you.

### Update your driver via official websites

 Synaptics have made an announcement on their official website that the corresponding drivers for TouchPad devices are “customized and supported by notebook manufacturers to meet specific driver requirements for their individual products.” So if you want to download the driver from official websites and then install it by yourself, you’ll need to visit the site of your notebook manufacturer. For instance, if you’re using a Dell laptop, you should go directly to Dell’s website and download the driver from it.

### Update your driver via Device Manager

 One of the most commonly used methods to update your driver is downloading and installing it from Device Manager. However, you should note that sometimes Windows may **fail to detect the latest (and even necessary) driver for your device** . In this way, you’ll have to search for the correct driver online or simply turn to[**Option 1**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

Here’re the steps to update your driver via Device Manager:

 1) Press the**Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type **devmgmt.msc**  and click**OK** .
