## Way 1: Download the MSI graphics card driver manually

 MSI provides the graphics driver on their website, for instance, the NVIDIA graphics card driver and the AMD graphics card driver. So you can check for and download the latest driver you need for your graphics card from MSI’s website. The driver always can be downloaded on the**SUPPORT** section.

 Go to **[MSI](https://us.msi.com/support/)**  website and enter the name of your graphics card and perform a quick search. Then follow the on-screen instructions to download the driver you need.
