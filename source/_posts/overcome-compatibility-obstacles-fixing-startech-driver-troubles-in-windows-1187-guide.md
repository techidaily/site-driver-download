### Option 1: Update your Arduino Uno driver manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

See how to do it:

 The screenshots below are from Windows 10, but the steps are also valid for other Windows system.

1. Go to the[official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/) . Then go to the**Software Downloads** section.
2. Click**Windows Installer, for Windows XP and up** .

3. Click Just Download. The driver .exe installation file would then be downloaded automatically.

4. On your keyboard, hold down the**Windows logo key** and then press**Pause** .
5. Click**Device Manager** .

6. Find and**right-click** your**Arduino Uno software** . Probably it’s listed under the**Other devices** section due to the problem. Then select**Update driver** .
7. Select**Browse my computer for driver software** .

8. Click the**Browse…** icon. Another window appears: go to the folder with the Arduino uno driver that you just downloaded. Select the drivers folder, then**OK** \>**Next** .

 If you’re prompted by the message that the board has not passed Windows Logo testing, click**Continue Anyway** .

 The Arduino Uno drivers should then be completely installed on your compouter.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Arduino Uno driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Move onto**Option 2** then.

### Option 2: Update your Ardunio Uno driver automactically

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
 Note: You can do it**for free** if you like, but it’s partly manual.
